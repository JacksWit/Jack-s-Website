                I started programming in highschool, starting with QBasic and html. I enjoyed making websites, 
                but when I was introduced to c++ in grade 12 I knew I had a passion for programming. However,
                I had decided to become a lawyer at an early age and continued to pursue that into university.
                I took a course in databases and SQL at university and continued to code some basic programs 
                from time-to-time. After university I got a job in finance and continued to progress through 
                various levels of financial advising. I believe I have reached the end of that journey and have 
                started to transition to a new journey in programming. I have learned python, JS and PHP while
                broadening my knowledge in html, CSS and SQL in order to one day achieve employment as a full 
                stack engineer.
